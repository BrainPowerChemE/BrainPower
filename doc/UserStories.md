#1 A principal investigator named Dr. MacCoss, he wants to use a machine learning tool with an easy user interface to identify new biomarkers for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases based on proteomics data collected using mass-spectrometry, in order to diagnose patients without having to physically see the brains post-mortem. He also wants to provide visualizations of the data and to be familiar with machine learning and programming, so that he can easily interpret and utilize the results.

#2 The software developer named Rosie, she use the algorithm to direct her investigation and discover new proteins that need to be added to the database, in order to improve the accuracy of the machine learning model. She also wants to be familiar with both the software and the data to ensure that the database is designed and updated properly for the machine learning model.

A principal investigator named Dr. MacCoss whose focus on 
mass-spectrometry proteomics. He is familiar in collecting the proteomics 
data through mass-spectrometry and is familiar with machine learning and 
programming. He wants to use this tool to identify biomarkers for 
Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. He wants an easy user interface that 
summarizes the data nicely. 



A clinician named Dr. Lisa Bob deals with older patients who might have 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers or Parkinsons and needs to 
input new information or updated diagnoses into the database. Dr. Bob also 
wants to see visualizations on specific patients to understand the risk of 
healthy patients. Dr. Bob does not have a technical background and needs 
an easy user interface. 

Karl is a biochemist in a research lab that wants to understand the 
biomarker in order to develop new drugs based on proteins identified by 
the computational tool. He is also using machine learning for this search. 

The software developer Rosie designed the initial database. She wants to 
use the algorithm to direct her investigation, and might discover new 
proteins that need to be added to the database. She is very familiar with 
the software and the data. 

A research scientist named Dr. Mike works on the wet lab experiment for 
each patient’s sample, performs the instrumental analysis and uploads new 
MSMS data. Dr. Mike does not have background knowledge in software 
development or machine learning, and needs an easy user interface.

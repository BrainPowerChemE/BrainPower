A principal investigator named Dr. MacCoss whose focus on 
mass-spectrometry proteomics. He is familiar in collecting the proteomics 
data through mass-spectrometry and is familiar with machine learning and 
programming. He wants to use this tool to identify biomarkers for 
Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s (with visualizations). 
He wants an easy user interface that summarizes the data nicely. 


The software developer Rosie designed the initial database. She wants to 
use the algorithm to direct her investigation, and might discover new 
proteins that need to be added to the database. She is very familiar with 
the software and the data.

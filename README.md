This GitHub page includes all of the code related to the development of a machine learning model for identifying biomarkers for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. The data comes from the MacCoss Lab and it is a proteomics dataset collected on cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) from patients with four condition groups: Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) and PD w/ Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Healthy. 
Alzheimer’s (AD) and Parkinson’s (PD) are the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases. Since there are limitations on the current biomarkers used, our goal is to identify new biomarkers that will be able to diagnose patients without having to physically see the brains post-mortem.
